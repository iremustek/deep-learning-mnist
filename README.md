## Dataset 
- MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image has a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

To access the MNIST dataset, you can refer to the following link: [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) 

## Modelling 

- Model A: Fully Connected Layers

- Model B: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Pre-Trained Network: EfficientNetB3
